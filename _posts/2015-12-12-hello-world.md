Hello World

I brought you some supper but if you'd prefer a lecture, I've a few very catchy ones prepped: sin and hellfire, one has lepers. Passion rules us all.

Why can't you just masturbate like the rest of us? You always hurt the one you love. I was actually at Woodstock. That was a weird gig. I fed off a flower person, and then I spent the next six hours watching my hand move. We're outlaws with hearts of gold. No, Angel, it's not you. My entire existence was constructed by a sociopath in a sweater vest; what do you suggest I do? The human mind is like Van Halen; if you just pull out one piece and keep replacing it, it just degenerates. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.
